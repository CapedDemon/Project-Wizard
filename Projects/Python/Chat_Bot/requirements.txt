Creating a fully working Python chatbot with advanced
natural language processing (NLP) capabilities requires
integration with external libraries and services.
One popular library for building chatbots is the
Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and,
for more advanced NLP, spaCy.
Additionally, you might want to utilize APIs or databases
to fetch data or perform specific tasks.
Here's an example of a basic chatbot using NLTK for language processing:

First, make sure you have NLTK installed. You can install it using pip:
bash :
pip install nltk

We use the NLTK library to define patterns and responses for the chatbot.
The chatbot also employs reflections to transform first-person pronouns
to second-person and vice versa, making the conversation more interactive.

This is a simple rule-based chatbot, and its capabilities are limited to
the predefined patterns. For more advanced chatbots with machine learning,
you'd typically use frameworks like Rasa, Dialogflow, or even OpenAI's GPT-3,
but these involve more complex setups.
